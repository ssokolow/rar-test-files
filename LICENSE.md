By design, the files within the archives have been created from scratch and are
minimally novel in the hope that they will be ineligible for copyright.

While I don't hold copyright to the self-extractor stubs present in the `.exe`
and `.bin` self-extracting test archives, they may be redistributed freely.

I hereby release anything in these archives that I _do_ hold copyright to into
the public domain using the Creative Commons

dedication.
